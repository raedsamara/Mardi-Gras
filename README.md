# Mardi-Gras



We are asked to build a website for an event that happens in New Orleans every year for two weeks. The event is called "Mardi Gras New Orleans".

Background:
The French Quarter of New Orleans, the largest city in the state of Louisiana in the southern United States, becomes for two weeks a year the focus of unrestrained parties and celebrations. The famous carnival, Mardi Gras (French for Fat Tuesday), held in many parts of the world, reaches new heights of beauty and joy unmatched anywhere else in New Orleans. The wonderful New Orleans Carnival, first begun in 1857 by French exiles, is a global attraction for thousands of locals and tourists planning to arrive in the city many months in advance. "Fat Tuesday", (the day of the beginning of the 40-day meat-eating fast until Easter) where two colorful carnival parades take place on St. Charles Street. A visit to the city during the carnival days guarantees the visitor a unique cultural experience.

Customer
The mayor of New Orleans is not so happy with the existing site for the festival:

https://www.mardigrasneworleans.com/

Although the site is beautiful and visually interesting, it has received a number of complaints from various sponsors in the city (mainly hotels, restaurants and more ... which fund some of the parade events) that are almost non-existent on the site. They want the site to show in the front page, in addition to the details of the festival, also pictures of the sponsors, their site, pictures of hotels, museums, bars, parking lots.

Sponsors List

Walk-On's Bistreaux and Bar
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel
Ace Hotel New Orleans
The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans
Premium Parking - P402

It is important that each of the sponsors appearing on the list have a page or at least a reference that includes photos and details. The customer stated that if the site is good, we can persuade more sponsors to join the financing of some of the municipality's productions in exchange for advertising on the new site.
